Day 1: Read first chapter of "Programming Massively Parallel Processors". Simple vector addition in cuda on leetgpu, then repeated on colab with memory management.

Day 2: Working through elementwise activations. ReLU, leaky ReLU, GELU and HardTanh. 

Day 3: Working on sum/Reduction. Got a working LeetGPU implementation for now, have to continue later. Doing final addition from each block on the CPU.
